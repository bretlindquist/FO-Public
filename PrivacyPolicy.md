# Privacy Policy for FO

**Last updated: April 24, 2024**

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing to use "FO", the timer app designed to help you manage problem-solving sessions effectively. This privacy policy outlines how the app uses and protects any information that you might configure while using it.

## Information We Collect

"FO" uses `@AppStorage` and `UserDefaults` to store your preferences and app settings locally on your device. These include:

- Timer settings
- Theme preferences (dark mode)
- Onboarding completion status
- Log of activities in the app (locally stored)

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All settings and logs are stored locally on your device and are not accessible to us or any third parties.**

## How We Use Your Information

The information stored in `@AppStorage` and `UserDefaults` is used to:

- Preserve your settings between app sessions, allowing for a personalized and consistent user experience.
- Maintain your app preferences, such as theme and timer settings, locally on your device.
- Record your progress through app features, such as completion of onboarding, to enhance usability.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information is largely dependent on the security of your device and the measures you take to protect it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me, Bret Lindquist, the developer of "FO". While the app does not collect feedback automatically, you are encouraged to reach out directly if you have feedback or just want to say thanks, which can help unlock additional features within the app.

This is my first app on the App Store, and I greatly value your feedback and support.
